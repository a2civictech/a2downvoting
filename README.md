cityscrape retrieves and caches web pages from the washtenaw county election site.  (the size of the cache for a given election is less than 2 MB.)  output is sorted by vote total.

running cityscrape might take a half minute or so the first time for a given election.  subsequent runs are instant-ish.

cityscrape reports:
	Registered Voters
	Total Ballots Cast
	Ballots cast for each city-wide race

cityscrape also reports if a race is partisan, and if it was unopposed (except for write-ins)

sometimes there are no city-wide races, e.g., nov 2015
